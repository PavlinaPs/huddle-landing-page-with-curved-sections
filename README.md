## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid areas
- Sass partials

### What I learned

This is my first junior challenge. I loved it. I realized again how important it is to plan ahead and before the first line of code. I had planned the flexboxes and grids before I started, but didn't plan enough for spilling backgrounds margins and paddings.

I decided to have the curves as and \<img> element, so it always stacks on top/under sections with the same background color. First tried it with pseudo-elements on sections but I couldn't guarantee the position when responsive. Or I don't know how to yet.

I am getting more familiar with Sass, I love partials, used nesting. Finally figured out @use and @forward since @import is deprecated.

I think I can handle simple e-mail validation quite well now.

### Continued development

I would like to explore and use more Sass features like mixins in the next challenges. I recently discovered the 7-1 Pattern, a way how to organize partials.

I also have some issues with organizing font sizes and media queries in Sass, I need to do some research on that.

I also saw two videos on form validation css and js, I am going to watch them again and code along to explore more possibilities when validating.
